# World Data SQL Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of fundamental SQL concepts using the 'world' dataset in MySQL. The objective is to showcase data manipulation, querying techniques, and database design understanding.

## Project Description
The 'world' database contains information about countries, cities, and languages. Through a series of SQL queries and operations, this project explores relationships between different entities, performs data aggregation, and extracts meaningful insights about the socio-economic and demographic aspects of nations.

## Database Schema
The database schema consists of three main tables:
- `city`: Contains data about cities around the world.
- `country`: Stores information about countries, including economic indicators and demographics.
- `countrylanguage`: Keeps records of languages spoken in each country.

(Include an entity-relationship diagram image or a link to one here, if you have it.)

## SQL Concepts Used
- Basic CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Joins (INNER and OUTER)
- Aggregation Functions and Grouping Data
- Subqueries and Nested Selects
- Data Types and Enumerations
- Indexing for Performance Optimization
